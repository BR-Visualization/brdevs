These black dots are connected by a solid purple segmented or curved line.\nThe white area below the threshold or tradeoff curve is the acceptance region.\n\nKey Conclusions:\n\nFor this hypothetical tradeoff plot, both the benefit and risk are the difference in proportions between four rival drug and the standard of care.\nSince the four drugs were approved by regulators, the tradeoff curve was drawn such that drugs appear in the acceptance region.\nThe tradeoff curve shows that subjects are willing to accept a higher risk for a higher benefit.\nThe MAB and MAR could be obtained from the company strategy TPVP document.\nIdeally, a drug closest to the lower right corner would be the most favorable option, and drug closest to the upper left corner would be least favorable.\nDrug A is more favorable than drugs B and C. There is a tradeoff between Drugs A and D. Severe subjects may prefer Drug A for its higher benefit, and mild subjects may choose drug D for its lower risk.\nThe plot can display other combinations of one benefit and one risk, as well as for different patient subgroups, dose levels, and studies, in support of the generalizability of the investigational drug.\nIdeally, the investigational drug will appear in an area of unmet need in the acceptance region."

The probabilities are estimated using logistic regression models with demographic and baseline covariates, but separately for one benefit and one risk.\nThe X-axis depicts the predicted incremental benefit.\nThe Y-axis depicts the predicted incremental risk.\nThe red triangle indicates the overall mean of predictive incremental probabilities associated with experiencing a benefit and a risk.\nThe diagonal threshold depicts the benefit and risk having equal weight.\nAs the slope increases, the benefit receives more weight than the risk, meaning subjects are willing to accept much more risk in exchange for more benefit.\nFor subjects in the upper left area, the risk exceeds the benefit.\nFor subjects in the lower right area, the benefit exceeds the risk.\n\nKey Conclusions:\n\nThe scatter plot of predictive incremental probabilities illustrates that 98.6% of subjects have benefit-risk predictive incremental probabilities that fall within the acceptance region, defined as the region below the diagonal threshold. Besides displaying subject variability, it indicates which subjects are most likely to benefit from the investigational drug."

For example, death typically occurs between 8 and 14 years since onset of disease.\nThe bars are color coded according to the three horizonal gray bands of functional scores (mild, moderate or severe) and the legend at the top.\n\nKey Conclusions:\n\nThe dark gray curve displays the downward trend in functional score or quality of life over time.\nThe graph show that the disease manifestations are sequential, hence do not necessarily occur at the same time. Patient follow-up will need to be several years to capture several of the functional domains.\nHistory of disease progression also impacts patient engagement, since newly diagnosed patients might have no experience with more serious manifestations, such as mental function."

A negative correlation might appear between a benefit and risk. This would suggest that subject experiencing the benefit also experience the risk.\nAs expected, there is a high correlation between the primary and secondary efficacy outcomes. The team might decide to drop the secondary efficacy outcome if there is a concern with double counting.\nThere is also an explainable negative correlation between outcomes for quality-of-life and recurring AE.

This generally means you’ll need to edit roxygen2 comments in an .R, not a .Rd file. You can find the .R file that generates the .Rd by reading the comment in the first line.\n\n\n\nIf you want to make a bigger change, it’s a good idea to first file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s needed. If you’ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal reprex (this will also help you write a unit test, if needed). See our guide on how to create a great issue for more advice.\n\n\n\nFork the package and clone onto your computer. If you haven’t done this before, we recommend using usethis::create_from_github(\"BR-Visualization/brdevs\", fork = TRUE).\nInstall all development dependencies with devtools::install_dev_deps(), and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running devtools::check(). If R CMD check doesn’t pass cleanly, it’s a good idea to ask for help before continuing.\nCreate a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using usethis::pr_init(\"brief-description-of-change\").\nMake your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running usethis::pr_push(), and following the prompts in your browser. The title of your PR should briefly describe the change. The body of your PR should contain Fixes #issue-number.\nFor user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of NEWS.md (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew code should follow the tidyverse style guide. You can use the styler package to apply these styles, but please don’t restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.\nWe use roxygen2, with Markdown syntax, for documentation.\nWe use testthat for unit tests. Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that the brdevs project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct.

    "text": "If you want to make a bigger change, it’s a good idea to first file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s needed. If you’ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal reprex (this will also help you write a unit test, if needed). See our guide on how to create a great issue for more advice.\n\n\n\nFork the package and clone onto your computer. If you haven’t done this before, we recommend using usethis::create_from_github(\"BR-Visualization/brdevs\", fork = TRUE).\nInstall all development dependencies with devtools::install_dev_deps(), and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running devtools::check(). If R CMD check doesn’t pass cleanly, it’s a good idea to ask for help before continuing.\nCreate a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using usethis::pr_init(\"brief-description-of-change\").\nMake your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running usethis::pr_push(), and following the prompts in your browser. The title of your PR should briefly describe the change. The body of your PR should contain Fixes #issue-number.\nFor user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of NEWS.md (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew code should follow the tidyverse style guide. You can use the styler package to apply these styles, but please don’t restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.\nWe use roxygen2, with Markdown syntax, for documentation.\nWe use testthat for unit tests. Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept."

The two positive trends indicate that both benefit and risk are higher for the active drug than placebo, but not at the same rate. This is an ideal scenario where the benefit increased with drug exposure while the risk plateaued."

For example, patients might place high importance in a drug that reduces severe hypertension.\nA display of background rates is also useful in determining whether a comorbidity is likely due to the drug or the disease."

Once subjects withdraw, they continued to be counted in the “Withdrew” category at subsequent visits.\nThe visualization compares the distribution of the five ordinal outcomes within a visit, across visits, and across doses.\n\nKey Conclusions:\n\nIn this hypothetical example, the placebo control group has more subjects with “No Benefit No AE.” The proportion of subjects with benefits is the highest in the high-dose group.\nThe most favorable outcome of “Benefit-No AE” is not only sustainable but the percentage of subjects is increasing.\nIt is expected that the percentage of subjects withdrawing increase over time, due to placebo subjects receiving no benefit and other subjects experiencing adverse events."

Occasionally it includes a measure of convenience and out-of-pocket expense.\n\nBenefits are statistically characterized at the right as means, mean change from baseline, proportions (ex.% Success), or rates.\n\nThe risks are typically organ toxicities or adverse events of special interest and can be statistically characterized as proportions or rates (ex. incidence per 100 subjects or per 10,000 subject-years).\nThe value tree can be used to facilitate team discussions about which outcomes to capture in a clinical study.\nValue trees can start with many branches that can be pruned or combined to form a smaller tree that best assess the tradeoffs between key benefits and key risks.\nIf two outcomes are highly correlated, then only one should be used, so as to avoid double counting.\nThe same outcome can be specified two different ways, either a clinical endpoint (ex. blood pressure) or a patient-focused outcome (ex. ability to climb stairs). The decision makers would need to decide which one to keep.\n\nKey Conclusions:\n\nThe size of this value tree was reduced by grouping frequently occurring adverse events into a single “recurring AE” outcome and grouping rare but serious adverse events into a single outcome.\nWhile also a rare and serious, liver toxicity was colored gray because it only has a potential association with treatments.\nBoth primary and secondary efficacy clinical endpoints were included because they were not correlated. Quality of Life was included to capture what was important to the subjects."
