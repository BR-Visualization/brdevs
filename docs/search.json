Occasionally it includes a measure of convenience and out-of-pocket expense.\n\nBenefits are statistically characterized at the right as means, mean change from baseline, proportions (ex.% Success), or rates.\n\nThe risks are typically organ toxicities or adverse events of special interest and can be statistically characterized as proportions or rates (ex. incidence per 100 subjects or per 10,000 subject-years).\nThe value tree can be used to facilitate team discussions about which outcomes to capture in a clinical study.\nValue trees can start with many branches that can be pruned or combined to form a smaller tree that best assess the tradeoffs between key benefits and key risks.\nIf two outcomes are highly correlated, then only one should be used, so as to avoid double counting.\nThe same outcome can be specified two different ways, either a clinical endpoint (ex. blood pressure) or a patient-focused outcome (ex. ability to climb stairs). The decision makers would need to decide which one to keep.\n\nKey Conclusions:\n\nThe size of this value tree was reduced by grouping frequently occurring adverse events into a single “recurring AE” outcome and grouping rare but serious adverse events into a single outcome.\nWhile also a rare and serious, liver toxicity was colored gray because it only has a potential association with treatments.\nBoth primary and secondary efficacy clinical endpoints were included because they were not correlated. Quality of Life was included to capture what was important to the subjects."

A negative correlation might appear between a benefit and risk. This would suggest that subject experiencing the benefit also experience the risk.\nAs expected, there is a high correlation between the primary and secondary efficacy outcomes. The team might decide to drop the secondary efficacy outcome if there is a concern with double counting.\nThere is also an explainable negative correlation between outcomes for quality-of-life and recurring AE. The medium positive correlation between recurring AE and primary efficacy is difficult to explain."

Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.\n\n\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at abigailmabe03@gmail.com.

No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.\n\n\n\nCommunity Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.\nConsequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.

This generally means you’ll need to edit roxygen2 comments in an .R, not a .Rd file. You can find the .R file that generates the .Rd by reading the comment in the first line.\n\n\n\nIf you want to make a bigger change, it’s a good idea to first file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s needed. If you’ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal reprex (this will also help you write a unit test, if needed). See our guide on how to create a great issue for more advice.\n\n\n\nFork the package and clone onto your computer. If you haven’t done this before, we recommend using usethis::create_from_github(\"BR-Visualization/brdevs\", fork = TRUE).\nInstall all development dependencies with devtools::install_dev_deps(), and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running devtools::check(). If R CMD check doesn’t pass cleanly, it’s a good idea to ask for help before continuing.\nCreate a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using usethis::pr_init(\"brief-description-of-change\").\nMake your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running usethis::pr_push(), and following the prompts in your browser. The title of your PR should briefly describe the change. The body of your PR should contain Fixes #issue-number.\nFor user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of NEWS.md (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew code should follow the tidyverse style guide. You can use the styler package to apply these styles, but please don’t restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.\nWe use roxygen2, with Markdown syntax, for documentation.\nWe use testthat for unit tests. Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that the brdevs project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By contributing to this project you agree to abide by its terms."
