Occasionally it includes a measure of convenience and out-of-pocket expense.\n\nBenefits are statistically characterized at the right as means, mean change from baseline, proportions (ex.% Success), or rates.\n\nThe risks are typically organ toxicities or adverse events of special interest and can be statistically characterized as proportions or rates (ex. incidence per 100 subjects or per 10,000 subject-years).\nThe value tree can be used to facilitate team discussions about which outcomes to capture in a clinical study.\nValue trees can start with many branches that can be pruned or combined to form a smaller tree that best assess the tradeoffs between key benefits and key risks.\nIf two outcomes are highly correlated, then only one should be used, so as to avoid double counting.\nThe same outcome can be specified two different ways, either a clinical endpoint (ex. blood pressure) or a patient-focused outcome (ex. ability to climb stairs). The decision makers would need to decide which one to keep.\n\nKey Conclusions:\n\nThe size of this value tree was reduced by grouping frequently occurring adverse events into a single “recurring AE” outcome and grouping rare but serious adverse events into a single outcome.\nWhile also a rare and serious, liver toxicity was colored gray because it only has a potential association with treatments.\nBoth primary and secondary efficacy clinical endpoints were included because they were not correlated. Quality of Life was included to capture what was important to the subjects."
